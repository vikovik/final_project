This final project was like a combination of all the skills acquired during the OOP345 course like it was with
the final project for OOP244 course. Therefore, it was not chance to practice new skill like while doing
workshops but more like a honing existing skills. While working on this project I had some troubles that I
finally was able to figure out how to solve them. Firs of all, while doing the last (third) milestone I needed
to change the CustomerOrder.cpp file because I forgot to put the reference in 1-argument constructor in the
parameter CustomerOrder::CustomerOrder(const std::string& str) while doing 2nd milestone. I didn't noticed it 
before and because of it I had some issues while doing 3d milestone only. Also I have had to add break to the
for loop in the first nested if statement in fillItem() function because without it my output in "Filling Orders"
section seemed like:
Line Manager Iteration: 1
Line Manager Iteration: 2
    Filled Chris S., Bedroom [Bed]
    Filled Chris S., Bedroom [Bed]
    Filled Chris S., Bedroom [Bed]
    Filled Chris S., Bedroom [Bed]
    Filled Cornel B., 1-Room Home Office [Desk]
and I didn't figured out how to fix it without adding break. I also noticed it while working on 3d milestone
only. Next, it was a bit hard to work on LineManager module because firstly I tried to use wile and for loops
in functions (except 2-argument constructor) and found that because of it my code was much longer and I had
so many errors, that is why I decided to use STL algorithms whenever it is possible.
